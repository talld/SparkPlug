# SparkPlug
C++ Vulkan Engine for small game projects
# Overview
A simple Vulkan implementation for a high degree of control of small and creative game projects
# Current features
* Basic Vulkan boilerplate
* Multiple Cameras with single Descriptor set
* File loading
* VMA memory allocation and Buffer creation
# Planned features
* Multiple Cameras with Multiple Descriptor sets
*  Multiple view ports from different Cameras
* Model loading from Piston multidata output file (see piston)
	* Level loading through a similar principle
* Compute shaders
* Multiple Command Buffers for chunk loading/unloading
* Runtime defragmentation through VMA
* component entity system
* Morph target animation
